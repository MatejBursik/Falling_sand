# Falling sand simulation in different languages

Me attempting to do make a falling sand simulation in different programming languages. The idea comes from [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4u7Zy_b868) and I wanted to expand on it by challenging my self to work with different programming languages.

## Languages (count = 4)
- Javascript (HTML)
- Python (PyGame)
- C++ (Win32)
- Java (Swing)
- Rust () https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a7Xtg2RgEo
