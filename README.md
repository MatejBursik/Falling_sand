# Falling sand simulation in different languages

Me attempting to do make a falling sand simulation in different programming languages. The idea comes from [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4u7Zy_b868) and I wanted to expand on it by challenging my self to work with different programming languages.

## Languages completed (count = 5)
- Javascript (HTML)
- Python (PyGame)
- C++ (Win32)
- Java (Swing)
- Rust (Bevy)

## Finding potential languages to use
- Ruby (Gosu)
- Lua (love2d)
- Fortran (OpenGL)
- Pascal (LCL - Lazarus Component Library)
- Lazarus (LCL - Lazarus Component Library)
- Lisp (CAPI, Cairo)
- Haskell (Gloss, Cairo)
- C++ (SDL3)
- C# (Veldrid, Silk)
- Bash (displayed in terminal)
